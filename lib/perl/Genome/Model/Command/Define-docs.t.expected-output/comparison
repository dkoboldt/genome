[4mREQUIRED INPUTS[0m
  [1mfrom-models[0m
    the models built in a prior way for which a new model will be made and tested (i.e.
    "groups.name=cancer-test1") 
  [1mchanges[0m
    changes to the "from" models which are being tested (param=value or input=value) 
  [1mprocessing-profile[0m
    the collection of parameters to be used during the build process 

[4mOPTIONAL INPUTS[0m
  [1madd-to-projects[0m
    add the new model to these projects (model groups) 
  [1mname[0m
    a friendly name for the new model (changeable) 

[4mDESCRIPTION[0m
    Compare a set of models (specifiable by expression) to a newlly built set with a specific set
    of changes to test.

    The changes are in the form key=value, where a key is a processing-profile parameter on the
    "from" model.

    The aspects to be compared are determined by the processing profile used by *this* model.

    WARNING: This is in development and currently does no work.
